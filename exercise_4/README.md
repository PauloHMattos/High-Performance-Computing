# Exercise 4

## About
This folder houses the fourth exercise of the COC472 - High Performance Computing course of the Computer Engineering couse at Eng Poli - UFRJ.

## Requirements
To run the code you will need a compiler with support for the OpenMP library. In this exercise I used the GCC compiler.

A utility script was implemented in Python. This script compiles an runs the code with the correct settings. To use this script install the Python requirements
``` bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Running
After installing the packages, run the `runner.py` to execute the binaries and generate the csv output with the data.

## Results
A report was made as part of the assignment (in portuguese), and can be read in `Trabalho_4.pdf`
